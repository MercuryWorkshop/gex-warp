//! Library functions the backend serves itself, instead of translating them.
//!
//! glibc's `memcpy` is a hand-written NEON loop; lifting it is correct but
//! slow, where wasm's `memory.copy` does the same work in one instruction.
//! Decompression and hashing (`apt update`, `xz`) spend most of their time
//! here. So, as box64 and FEX do, the function is recognised by name -- from
//! the symbol table discovery already reads -- and bound to a host builtin.
//!
//! Safety against substituting the wrong function: a symbol here is `STT_FUNC`
//! (`elf::load` keeps no other kind), naming a definition in this object's
//! text. aarch64 glibc resolves `memcpy` through an IFUNC, whose
//! `STT_GNU_IFUNC` resolver symbol never reaches this table; what reaches it
//! is the real `__memcpy_generic` and siblings the resolver returns.
